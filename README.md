# node-cucumber

Docker image running node + cucumber (on top of ruby).

To use it you need just to run the image sharing your cucumber tests and then execute cucumber.

## TODOs

As this is an image still in progress and with no commitment with compatibility I do not advise anyone to create any dependency over this.

If you do, do it aware of the possible consequences.

Known TODOs:
* add examples of how to run the image out of the box
* add examples of how to create images extending this one
* review the viability of changing `chromedriver-helper` by `webdrivers`.
